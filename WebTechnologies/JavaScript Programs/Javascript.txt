Java Script
    - web based interpreter scripting language.

    ES5 - ECMA Script - European Computer Manufacture Association.

    Object based interpreter scripting language.

    <script type = "text/javascript"> - opening tag
    </script> - closing tag

    This can be written in between head tag, body tag and without them also possible but not advisible.

    document.write("Heyy !!"); - case sensitive and semicolon isnt necessary in Java Script.

    Variable and data types
        - var variableName; (var-up to ES5 JS.)
    datatypes:
        1. Number
        2. string
        3. Boolean
        4. Obect reference.

    Operators:
        1. Arithmetic Operators: +,-,*,/,%
        2. Relational operators: >,>=,<,<=,==,!=
        3. Assignment operators: =
        4: ===,:
        5. Logical operators: &&,||,!
        6. Typeof operator or function
    
    Conditions:
        1. simple if statement
        2. if else
        3. if else if
        4. switch statement

    loops - initialization, condition, increment/decrement.
        1. while loop
        2. do while loop
        3. for loop

    Day 6

    Functions and Events
        - pre defined functions.
            document.write("welcome to JS");
            1. alert("Any message");
            2. prompt("msg") - it receives input from the user.
            3. eval() - use to convert string to number.
                   - parseInt() - string to initialization
                   - parseFloat() - string to float
        
        - User defined functions.
            - its always good to write the user defined functions in head part.
            - function functionName(parameterList)
                {

                } 
            - calling functions in body part.
        
        - Events
            -


JSON - Java script onject Notation
JSON is used to share the data between one application to another application.
JSON stores the data in key value pairs.
    - where key is string type and value is Boolean type.

JSON.stringify() - JSON to string conversation
JSON.parse() - String to JSON conversation

Storage Objects
    - HTML5/JavaScript provide two types of stroage objects.
    1. sessionStroage: it hold the value till application closed.
                        Once application closed the value gt destroy from session.
    2. localStroage: it hold the value in secondary memory ,
                    after closing the application also we can get next time when we open the application.


    using stroage object we can share the value between more than one page or application.

    one.js
        sessionStroage.setItem("key",value);
        localStroage.setItem("key",value);

    two.js
        sessionStroage.gettItem("key");
        localStroage.getItem("key");

        sessionStroage.removeItem("key");
        localStroage.removeItem("key");

Day 7:

Functions
1. Normal function
2. Expression style function   
    - with functionName
    - without functionName
3. callback function
    - passing the function body or function itself to
     another function is known as callback functions.
4. Arrow function - kinda lamda function in java.
5.  IIFE - Immediate Invoke Function Expression 
    - when you want to immediately only once, 
     without depend uppn events or another script.

Arrays
1. var onject = [100,200]; // creating object using literal style.
2. var object1 = new Array(100,200); // creating using new keyword.
    - forEach


User Defined Objects
    -refer jsuserdefinedobjects.js and html files.
creating user defined objects using ES5 style
    function employee()
    {

    }

Synchronous and Asynchronous Commuication.

synchronous Communication: This code is executed in sequence.
Asynchronous Communication: This code execute independently.

setTimeout() - predefined function which is used to 
                achieve asynchrnous Communication.
setInterval() 

Promise: promise is a predefined object 
provided by java which help to handle Asynchronous operation.
It also handle error.
It has 4 states:
    1. Fulfilled: when promise is success
    2. Rejected: when promise is failure
    3. Pending: when promise is pending state
    4. Settled: when promise is completed
